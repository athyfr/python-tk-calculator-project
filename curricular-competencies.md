## Competencies Met

## Competencies

### Grade 11 CS Curricular Competencies

#### Reasoning and Modelling/Analyzing

- Develop flexible thinking to analyze and create algorithms
- Explore, analyze, and apply mathematical ideas and computer science concepts
  using reason, technology, and other tools
- Model with mathematics in situational contexts
- Think creatively and with curiosity and wonder when exploring problems

#### Understanding and Solving

- Develop, demonstrate, and apply conceptual understanding through
  experimentation, inquiry, and problem solving
- Visualize to explore and illustrate computer science concepts and
  relationships
- Apply flexible and strategic approaches to solve problems
- Solve problems with persistence and a positive disposition
- Engage in problem-solving experiences connected with place, story, cultural
  practices, and perspectives relevant to local First Peoples communities, the
  local community, and other cultures

#### Communicating and Representing

- Explain and justify mathematical ideas and decisions in many ways
- Represent computer science ideas in concrete, pictorial, symbolic, and
  pseudocode forms
- Use computer science and mathematical vocabulary and language to contribute to
  discussions in the classroom
- Take risks when offering ideas in classroom discourse

### Grade 11 Math Curricular Competencies

#### Reasoning and Modelling/Analyzing

- Estimate reasonably
- Develop mental math strategies and abilities to make sense of quantities
- Use reasoning and logic to explore and make connections

#### Understanding and Solving

- Using multiple strategies to engage in problem solving (i.e. Visual, oral,
  role-play, experimental, written, symbolic)
- Develop, construct, and apply mathematical understanding through role-play
  inquiry, and problem-solving.
- Engage in problem-solving experiences that are connected to place, story and
  cultural practices relevant to the local community

#### Communicating and Representing

- Communicate in many ways (concretely, pictorially, symbolically, and using
  spoken or written language to express, describe, explain, and apply
  mathematical ideas)
- Describe, create, and interpret

#### Connecting and Reflecting

### Grade 12 CS Curricular Competencies

#### Reasoning and Modelling

- Develop fluent, flexible, and strategic thinking to analyze and create
  algorithms

  discussions in the classroom
- Take risks when offering ideas in classroom discourse

#### Connecting and Reflecting

- Reflect on mathematical and computational thinking
- Connect mathematical and computer science concepts with each other, other
  areas, and personal interests
- Use mistakes as opportunities to advance learning
- Incorporate First Peoples worldviews, perspectives, knowledge, and practices
  to make connections with computer science concepts

### Grade 12 CS Content

#### Advanced Variable Usage

Document where immutability is used. Document where pass-by-reference is
implicitly active (mapping types and objects)

Pass-by-reference is harder to demonstrate in a Python project, as they
discourage it, and use other syntactical features in its place.

- Mutability vs. immutability
- Pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference

#### Data-Structures

Understanding of data-structures and use-cases. Document usage of these.

- vectors
- lists
- queues
- dictionaries
- maps
- trees
- stacks

#### Classical Algorithms

Sorting:

- bubble
- insertion
- selection
- quick-merge

Searching:

- binary search
- data-structure traversal

#### Big-O Notation

- Analyzing algorithms to predict and compare run-time complexity.
- Working with large data-sets.

#### File Storage

- Understanding of directory structure.
- Ability to use libraries for abstracted data-storage (such as JSON).
- Ability to save multiline strings to files.
- Ability to save raw bytes to files.
- Understanding of different read/write modes (e.g. write vs. append).
