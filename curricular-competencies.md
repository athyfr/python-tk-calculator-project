## Competencies Met

## Competencies

### Advanced Variable Usage

Document where immutability is used. Document where pass-by-reference is
implicitly active (mapping types and objects)

Pass-by-reference is harder to demonstrate in a Python project, as they
discourage it, and use other syntactical features in its place.

- Mutability vs. immutability
- Pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference

### Data-Structures

Understanding of data-structures and use-cases. Document usage of these.

- vectors
- lists
- queues
- dictionaries
- maps
- trees
- stacks

### Classical Algorithms

Sorting:

- bubble
- insertion
- selection
- quick-merge

Searching:

- binary search
- data-structure traversal

### Big-O Notation

- Analyzing algorithms to predict and compare run-time complexity.
- Working with large data-sets.

### File Storage

- Understanding of directory structure.
- Ability to use libraries for abstracted data-storage (such as JSON).
- Ability to save multiline strings to files.
- Ability to save raw bytes to files.
- Understanding of different read/write modes (e.g. write vs. append).
