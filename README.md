# Python Calculator Project

## Goal

This project is made to try to fulfill this requirement:

> "I'll make a calculator project to demonstrate several recursive algorithms
> (Fibonacci, exponents, factorials, palindromes, combinations, greatest
> common factor)"

## Layout

<!-- Pandoc grid_tables format used. -->

Arithmetic buttons:

+:-:+:-:+:-:+:-:+
| 7 | 8 | 9 | / |
+---+---+---+---+
| 4 | 5 | 6 |\* |
+---+---+---+---+
| 1 | 2 | 3 |\- |
+---+---+---+---+
| 0 | . | = |\+ |
+---+---+---+---+

## Functions

This calculator GUI uses Python's `eval()` function, so Python expressions are
used for calculations.

Python's math library is imported using `from math import *`, so any functions
from that may be used. Some of these functions are overridden with custom
implementations to demonstrate my understanding of them.
